<h2>Website Page Title
    <h4> There is a < title > within the < head > tag.
<h2>Image Text Alternatives
    <h4> There is alt text for all the images on the library page.
<h2>Text
    <h4>There is very low contast between text and background colors on a lot of the text. This occurred in 27 places.
 <br>When scaled up to 200% the text was still readable, both on the computer and on my samsung smartphone. I was able to scale it up using keyboard commands. 
<br> There was an empty link with no text.
<h2>Interaction
    <h4>Using only keyboard keys to navigate the website was effective. All pages could be opened, however it wasn't always possible to go back to the landing page.
<h2>General
    <h4>There were no image carousels, flashing or blinking content. When I removed the CSS styling the website became much harder to navigate.
    There are two mains. According to W3 Schools, there must not be more than one < main > element in a document. 

<h2>Final Thoughts
    <h4>The 14 errors on this page were all due to a broken ARIA menu.
