    &emsp;I hope this message finds you well. My name is Melzy Wise and I am currently working towards my Master of Library and Information Science at the University of Denver. This class, web content management, is teaching me about digital accessibility, including making sure to test web content so it is accessible to people with disabilities and that use assistive technologies.
<br>
&emsp;We will all be disabled at one point or another in our lives, even able-bodied people.  The process of aging causes our eyesight to worsen, our mobility to decrease or sometimes even fail, and our hand eye coordination to deteriorate. Some of us will get into accidents or suffer illness that impacts our full range of motion, ability to navigate technology like using a keyboard and mouse. Whether from the natural process of aging to an unexpected mishap, we will all be disabled at some point, sooner or later. 
    <br>&emsp;That’s why accessibility is so important- because it truly is for everyone. That being said, the purpose of this report is to help identify potential accessibility issues. I graduated from Hampshire in 2015, so I wanted to evaluate the library’s website as I spent many hours studying there. Hampshire is still near and dear to my heart.
   <br> &emsp;The following accessibility checklist is based on the W3 schools WAI Easy Checks. 
    

<h1>Website Page Title </h1>
<p><p>&#10145; Having a good, well-labelled page title helps users that may be using a screen reader. It is also helpful to folks who may be using their keyboard to navigate instead of a mouse. It helps with orientation, both knowing where one is and moving between pages in the browser tab.</p>
    <p> &#9940; There is a < title > within the < head > tag. This may be confusing for those using a screen reader.  </p>
    
<h2>Image Text Alternatives </h2>
<p>&#10145; Providing alt text for images is an easy way to increase accessibility. Users that may be visually impaired, are using assistive devices like screen readers, or those with a slow internet conenction or older browser can still learn from content that otherwise might be missing.</p>
    <p>  &#11088; There are image text alternatives (alt text) for all the images on the library page. Well done!</p>
    <p>&#9940; There was one instance of redundant alt text, as there were two different places to select the option to chat with a librarian. </p>
<h3>Text</h3>
<p>&#10145; Headings, contrast ratio (color contrast) and resizing text should not only support visual aesthetics but also support the navigation and visibility of text content. </p>
    <p>&#9940; There is very low contast between text and background colors on a lot of the text. This occurred in 27 places total. On the library homepage all the colors of hours, featured spaces, policies and information, and staff directory have a color contrast ratio of 3.39:1 (the ratio that has to be met according to W3 school's accessibility checks cannot be less than 4.5:1)  Low contrast makes it difficult for visually impaired or colorblind users to access legible content on the website. It can also affect older users that may only be accostomed to analog reading, so viewing text on a screen is more difficult even with good contrast. </p>
    &#11088; When scaled up to 200% the text was still readable, both on the computer, a samsung smartphone, and an iPad. Keyboard commands were effective in scaling up the size. Very good!
<p>&#9940; There is an empty link with no text. The image looks like it should lead back to Hampshire's main web page. The code for this empty link is: "< a class="breadcrumb__home-icon" href="/"></ a>" An empty link can be confusing for users attempting to navigate with a keyboard only.</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2><h2></h2>
<p> &#10145; Many people cannot use a mouse and rely on a keyboard to interact with web pages. Keyboard focus should be clearly visible and should follow a logical order through the page elements. Visible keyboard focus could be a border or highlight. Providing a "skip to main" as part of the keyboard navigation options is very useful for users in this category. 
    <p>&#11088; Using only keyboard keys to navigate the website was effective. All pages could be opened, however it wasn't always possible to go back to the landing page. That being said, the keyboard only navigation worked very well, great job!</p>
    <p>&#11088; Visual focus was also very good. It was clear what element was selected while using the tab keyboard key to navigate this webpage. Also, the "skip to main" rocks!</p>
    <p>&#11088; Search fields worked- both for searching Hampshire's website as well as the Five College Consortium library catalog.</p>
    <p>&#9940; The chat with library staff link opened a new window, however the chat interface itself did not work properly (it failed to load.)</p>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>&#10145; There were no image carousels, flashing or blinking content that might impact those affected by flashing elements. When I removed the CSS styling the website became much harder to navigate.
    <p>&#9940; There are two mains. According to W3 Schools, there must not be more than one < main > element in a document. This helps with clarity of organization. </p> 
        <p>&#9940; There is a skipped heading level in the code for the library website. Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. Skipping a heading level may be confusing for these users. /p>


<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>&#10145; The 14 errors on this page were all due to a broken ARIA menu items. There were a lot of contrast errors. The ease of navigating using a keyboard only was very good.</p>
    <p>&#10145; To fix the skipped heading level, we suggest restructuring the document headings to ensure that heading levels follow a sequential order.</p>
    <p>&#128151; Thank you for taking the time to review this accessibility audit. &#128151; </p>
