<h1>Website Page Title </h1>
    <p> There is a < title > within the < head > tag. Having a good, well-labelled page title helps users that may be using a screen reader. It is also helpful to folks who may be using their keyboard to navigate instead of a mouse. It helps with orientation, both knowing where one is and moving between pages in the browser tab. </p>
    
<h2>Image Text Alternatives </h2>
    <p> There are image text alternatives (alt text) for all the images on the library page. This is especially useful for those using a screen reader, or for any user who cannot view images. This makes all of the content on the web page accessible, even if the user has a slow internet connection.</p>
<h3>Text</h3>
    <p>There is very low contast between text and background colors on a lot of the text. This occurred in 27 places. Low contrast makes it difficult for visually impaired or colorblind users to access legible content on the website. </p>
 <br>When scaled up to 200% the text was still readable, both on the computer and on my samsung smartphone. I was able to scale it up using keyboard commands. 
<br> There was an empty link with no text.
<h2>Interaction</h2><h2></h2>
    <p>Using only keyboard keys to navigate the website was effective. All pages could be opened, however it wasn't always possible to go back to the landing page.</p>
<h2>General</h2>
    <p>There were no image carousels, flashing or blinking content that might impact those affected by flashing elements. When I removed the CSS styling the website became much harder to navigate.
    <p>There are two mains. According to W3 Schools, there must not be more than one < main > element in a document. This helps with clarity of organization. </p> 

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The 14 errors on this page were all due to a broken ARIA menu items. There were a lot of contrast errors. The ease of navigating using a keyboard only was very good.</p>
